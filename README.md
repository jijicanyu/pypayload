# PyPayload
Automatic Metasploit Payload Generator

## Introduction

__Metasploit__ is a great suite for penetration testing. However, I tend to find it a hassle to create a payload utilizing Metasploit's __msfvenom__, and created this project in order to automate that process.


## Dependencies

* Metasploit
* Python 2.7.x
* Git

## Download & Installation

Get the repository off of Github by cloning it:

    git clone https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/pypayload

Change into the pypayload directory:

    cd /path/to/pypayload

Execute with python:

    python pypayload.py

The generated payload will be in the same directory as pypayload.
